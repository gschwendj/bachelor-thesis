\section{Project Plan}

The procedure of the thesis was esteemed wrong. At the beginning it was not clear which of the task are complex and if it has to be done at all. The GNSS localization by Cohda Wireless was not accurate enough to detect a parking lot. In the specification sheet an accuracy of 2.5\;m is defined. 
The system should not be mounted to the charging device, as it is described in the task.
